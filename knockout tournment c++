There are N teams participating in a knockout tournament (where if a team loses a game, then it is
out of the tournament). Each team is assigned an ID. In this tournament,the ID of the first team is 1,
second team is 2, and so on till upto N. The strength of each team is decided by the strength
that it contains in the following units:
Batting
Bowling
Fielding
All-rounder&#39;s performance
Captain&#39;s performance
Now, a team can win against another team if it can win at least 3 units. If a team&#39;s strength in a
specific unit is higher than the other team, then the former team wins that specific unit. In case, the
strength of both teams are the same in a specific unit, then the team that contains the lower team
ID wins that unit.
